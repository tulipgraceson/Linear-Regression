I have used a simple 2 column Linear regression dataset for the salary prediction of an employee based on his years of experience.
I came across this dataset while I was learning ML from a course. 
We have first cleaned the dataset, then split it for training and after the prediction a simple graph has been plotted to compare our prediction with the actual value.
At the last we calculated the R2 score value, and it came out to be a good 0.988 (not surprised)
